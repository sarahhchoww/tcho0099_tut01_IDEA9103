# Individual prototype for major assignment of IDEA9103
## How to interact
There is no need for any user input. You may just sit back and enjoy how the circles orbit around one and other and the stars float around. With each refresh, the position and color of the circle changes.
## Mechanism of my work
I have modified the group work with <b>Perlin noise and randomness</b></br>
### Animation
The size of the circles, the white dots in the background, and the colors of the circles are set to animate. Perlin noise has been used to create smoother animations. For example, if perlin noise has not been used for the color animation, the colors would keep flashing which breaks the tranquility of the rest of the work.</br>
### Originality
In addition to the gorup work, this sketch now looks more like the galaxy as the cirlces are in circular movement. This is well thought through, as the magnitude and direction of movement has a great impact for the big picture. Their movement is set in a circular route at different angles and speeds, morderated by perlin noise. To match the theme, the white dots in the background also danced in the same way. Their randomised alpha values also provided visual depth. The rotating 'dash rings' also gives the feeling of 'self rotating planets'.</br>

Short technical explanation here </br>
The first step is to remove noLoop() since my work involves animation. This will prevent the sketch from being static.</br>
