# Individual prototype for major assignment of IDEA9103
## How to interact
## Mechanism of my work
I have modified the group work with <b>Perlin noise and randomness</b></br>
Which properties are animated </br>
How different from other members </br>
Reference gif/img; no techniqie needed here </br>
Short technical explanation here </br>
The first step is to remove noLoop() since my work involves animation. This will prevent the sketch from being static.</br>
